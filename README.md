Create a mobile application for iOS in Swift that uses the Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co) to display the list of pokemons and visualize their descriptive card.

Requirements:

- Initial screen displaying a list of available pokemons (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/).
- Allow selecting any pokemon from the list and display a screen containing the descriptive card of the pokemon with details.
- Enable a search bar in the pokemon list to filter or find a pokemon by name.

Considerations:

- Use only native components (avoid third-party libraries).
- Display a loader on the screen while loading information.
- There should be a list of pokemon with only the first generation.
- On the pokemon detail screen, display preferred information, suggested: name, sprites, types, abilities, moves, and stats.
- Use UIKit or SwiftUI according to your preference.
- The application must be compatible with different models of iPhone and iPad.
- Create the design of the screens as you prefer.
- Implement the solution in one of the following architectures: VIP, VIPER, MVP.
- Upload the source code to a public github repository and send the link for review.

Criteria for evaluation:

- Software development best practices.
- Clean code.
- Architecture and separation of layers.
- Graphical interface and navigation.
